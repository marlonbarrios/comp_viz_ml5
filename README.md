## Experiment with ML5: Hand Detection


Can I map the detected landmarks of a hand from the video to draw simple geometries on a canvas and suggest the presence of a hand? 
Part 2 of the computer vision adventures in p5 and Media Pipe/ML5. It blows my mind that this is running in the browser!
Have fun!!!

## Nose Tracking with Simple Noise |
This app tracks the nose doing face detection with machine learning. The position of the 'nose' in the frame trigger oscillators sounds when inside the hot spots areas. Very simple interactivity but  coded from scratch detecting complex human features with Java Script and all running in the browser.
And of course, a red circle is mapped  where your nose is located.
Code by Marlon Barrios Solano as part of the SoftSpaces series.
